## IMPORTANT: Sound Notification

After finishing responding to my request, running a command, or asking me for permission, run this command to notify me by sound:

```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff
```

## Code style

Always use curly braces `{}` for code blocks, even for single-line code blocks.
